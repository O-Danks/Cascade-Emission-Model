This repository contains the three simulations used to model vibrational fluorescence beginning from Gaussian anharmonic frequency .log output.

The simulations should be run in the following order:
1. VDOS.py
2. energy_dependent_spectra.py
3. cascade_emission.py

The development of these simulations is described in detail in the 'Implementation of Methods' section of the MSci Project Report 'Investigating the vibrational fluorescence of interstellar deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with a cascade emission model'.

This work was inspired by the works of Basire. et al and Mackie et al. over the last 20 years.
